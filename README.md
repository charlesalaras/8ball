# 8 Ball (C++)
## Description

This is a simple 8 Ball program coded in C++.

## Requirements
Requires a C++ compiler in order to use (recommend g++), possibly will add a .exe if there's interest, however you can easily create said file with g++ by typing:
`g++ 8ball.cpp -o 8ball.exe` (NOTE: This works for Windows, for Linux distros type `g++ 8ball.cpp -o 8ball.out`

In the future, when other versions are available, I will update this with ways to run the program.

## Memory Constraints
One thing I would like to fix up is the memory footprint this program has currently. Potentially, I could insert another file with the responses and just read from there. If so, I will make a separate edition using that method, rather than storing it all on stack memory. Either way, if there's anything I can do to make this program more efficient, feel free to fork / do your own work on it.

## TO DO
- Create Python, Go, JavaScript versions.
- Making it more efficient / lighter.
- Beautifying.
