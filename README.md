# 8 Ball (C++)
## Description

This is a simple 8 Ball program coded in C++.

## Requirements
Requires a C++ compiler in order to use (recommend g++), possibly will add a .exe if there's interest, however you can easily create said file with g++ by typing:
`g++ 8ball.cpp -o 8ball.exe`

## Memory Constraints
One thing I would like to fix up is the memory footprint this program has currently. I'm pretty sure it's decently light, since it uses a vector to store possible responses, but I wasn't too certain how light it was considering the behavior of vectors. Either way, if there's anything I can do to make this program more efficient, feel free to fork / do your own work on it.

## TO DO
- I will be creating a python version of this program soon.
- Making it more efficient / lighter.
- Beautifying.
